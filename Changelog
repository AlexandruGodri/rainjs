# Changelog

## 0.4.0

* View urls use the same scheme as other resources (with /htdocs included).
* Client-side controller are fully supported, may be defined by <script type="client-side-controller" src=""> or
  inside the component meta file, see the example in _skeleton. 
* Components now have individual meta.json files, there is no global configuration file anymore.
* On startup, the component root folder is scanned for components which are then auto-registered.
* The server-side controller paths were fixed. 
* Views support the rain.output request parameter, may be either 'html' or 'json'. 
* Nested components are now fully supported, it is now possible to define child content for tags that is correctly
  resolved. 
* Tags may now use different views of a component, see the default server configuration. Components can thus be used 
  like tag libraries.  
* The render code was rewritten, mostly from scratch. 
* Many improvements in the supplied example components.
