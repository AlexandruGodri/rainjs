    :param Object options: 
        the component options 
    
    :param String options.name: 
        indicates the component from which the content will be aggregated. When this option is missing the current component will be used (the version is always the current version in this case). 
    
    :param String options.version: 
        the version of the component specified with the previous option. If the version is not specified the latest version will be used. You can also use version fragments as described in the documentation for component versioning. When you specify the version you also need to specify the name of the component, otherwise an error will be thrown. 
    
    :param String options.view: 
        the view that will be aggregated. 
    
    :param String options.sid: 
        the component static id, used in the client-side controller (*Default*: 'undefined')
    


    
    :throws Error:
        : when the context has the wrong keys
    


    
    :returns String:
        the generated custom HTML tag 
    


The helper receives in the context information about the Rain environment, like the current
component and the current list of existing versioned components.

The helper decides what view should use and from what component, adds the information to the
tag library of the current component and then generates the HTML tag.

To determine what component and view to use, the following steps are performed:

1. the view id is required!

2. if the version is specified, the name of the component must be specified too.
