Below you can find a bunch of useful commands to use::

   rain --help
   
   Usage:
   
   $ rain
   
   Commands:
   
   $ create-project <path> <project-name> 
   create a project 
   
   $ create-component <component-name> 
   create a component 
   
   $ start [#pid] 
   1. on project root the command starts the server and creates an pid file 
   
   $ stop [#pid] 
   1. on project root the command stops the associated server 
   2. with [#pid] stops the server with the associated process id 
   
   $ restart [#pid] 
   1. on project root the command restarts the associated server 
   2. with [#pid] restarts the server with the associated process id 
   
   $ list [server|mothership] 
   lists all running server/motherships, with [type] only 1 of both will be displayed 
   
   $ stopall 
   shutting down all server and motherships
   Options:
   
   -h, --help output usage information 
   -d, --debug debugging 
   -c, --conf <path_to_conf> start server with custom configuration 
   -m, --mothership-conf <path_to_conf> start server with custom mothership configuration 
   -p, --platform <platform> choose the platform for the application Available platforms: nodejs 
   Examples:
   
   $ rain create-project /home/username/workspace newProject 
   $ rain start 
   $ rain start -c /home/username/workspace/custom_confs/server.conf 
   $ rain start -m /home/username/workspace/custom_confs/mothership.conf $ rain stop $ rain stop 5361 
   Rain creates following structure on first start of a server
   
   /home/user/.rain 
   A server pid file contains "PID /path/to/server-conf" and looks like this "rain.server.5734" -> rain.server.PID
   
   A mothership file contains the complete mothership configuration and looks like this "rain.ms.31337.11324" -> rain.ms.PORT.PID
   
   Creating an Application
   2 modes will be available: quick mode and configuration mode (default)
   
   "Quick mode" creates the project with the nodejs skeleton and standard meta.json
   
   "Configuration mode" asks the user about different settings
