The helper receives in the context information about the injected css file.

To determine the path for the css file, the following steps are performed:

1. if the component key is not specified, the current component id will be used.

2. if the version is not specified and the component key is present, the latest version
   for the component at step 1 is found and used.

3. The file has to be located in ``client/css/``.
