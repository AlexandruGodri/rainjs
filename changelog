## Version 0.4

* Path to views now conform to other paths, i.e. they contain 'htdocs'.
* No more global component configuration from a single file (may reappear at a later stage). 
  Components bring their own meta file in <component folder>/meta.json and are automatically
  registered at module container startup. 
* Nested components are now correctly resolved.
* Completely rewritten renderer
